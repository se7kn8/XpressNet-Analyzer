  # XpressNet-Analyzer

(_Work in Progress_)

A high level logic analyzer for Saleae Logic 2.

This extension provides support for XpressNet 3.0 a protocol by Lenz which is a protocol used in model railroads for communication.
To use this analyzer you first need an Async-Serial low lever decoder.

All packets are based on this documentation: [XpressNet-V3.0](https://wiki.rocrail.net/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=xpressnet:xpressnet-v2.pdf) and [XpressNet-V3.6](https://wiki.rocrail.net/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=xpressnet:xpressnet-lan-usb-23151-v1.pdf)

This analyzer is not complete, the table shows the current progress

### Corrected functions
The function status functions are corrected. They now show if a function is a momentary or toggle function
The new status requests and responses report the status as follows:

|Char|Function|Description|
|----|--------|:---------:|
|M|Momentary function|When on a device the function button is pressed the function is ON, when the button is released the function is OFF again|
|T|Toggle function|When on a device the function button is pressed this function is ON, when the button is pressed again the function is OFF|

### Changed address representation
The address representation has changed. If the high byte of the address is 0x00, than the address is between 0 and 99. Only the low byte is used for the address.
If the high byte not is 0x00, than the address is between 100 and 9999. The address is shown as a readable address by filtering out the MSB 15 and 14.

### Following ROCONET extensions have been implemented:
 - Track power off: Short circuit


### TODOs:
 - Allow setting the accessory decoder address format (turnout, switching decoder, feedback module)
 - Handle other accessory decoders than switching decoders
